# Class-Weighted Convolutional Features for Image Retrieval
Master thesis by Albert Jimenez. Co-advised by Jose Maria Alvarez (NICTA) and Xavier Giro-i-Nieto (UPC).

## Abstract 
Recently lots of works have proven that using Convolutional Neural Networks as feature extractors is very e ective at tackling image retrieval tasks. In our work we explore encoding images based on their predicted semantics, building descriptors that gather more rel- evant knowledge about the scenes. We propose a retrieval pipeline where we employ Class Activation Maps to spatially weight con- volutional features given the objects location.  is class activation maps can be further exploited in a post re-ranking stage where they can provide an easy manner to compute regions of interest. Our ex- periments on two publicly available datasets, Oxford5k and Paris6k, demonstrate that our system is competitive and even outperforms the current state-of-the-art in o -the-shelf image retrieval.
