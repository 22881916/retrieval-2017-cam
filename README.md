# Class-Weighted Convolutional Features for Image Retrieval
Master thesis by Albert Jimenez. Co-advised by Jose Maria Alvarez (NICTA) and Xavier Giro-i-Nieto (UPC).

## Abstract 
Recently lots of works have proven that using Convolutional Neural Networks as feature extractors is very effective at tackling image retrieval tasks. In our work we explore encoding images based on their predicted semantics, building descriptors that gather more relevant knowledge about the scenes. We propose a retrieval pipeline where we employ Class Activation Maps to spatially weight convolutional features given the objects location. This class activation maps can be further exploited in a post re-ranking stage where they can provide an easy manner to compute regions of interest. Our experiments on two publicly available datasets, Oxford5k and Paris6k, demonstrate that our system is competitive and even outperforms the current state-of-the-art in off-the-shelf image retrieval.
